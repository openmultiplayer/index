# Open Multiplayer

An upcoming multiplayer mod for _Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas_ that will be fully backwards compatible with the existing multiplayer mod _San Andreas Multiplayer._

<br />

This means **the existing SA:MP client and all existing SA:MP scripts will work with open.mp** and, in addition to this, many bugs will also be fixed within the server software without the need for hacks and workarounds.

If you're wondering when the public release is planned or how you can help contribute to the project, please see [this forum thread](https://www.burgershot.gg/showthread.php?tid=99) for more information.
